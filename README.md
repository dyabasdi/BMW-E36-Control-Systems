Project Scope: This repository has the source code for the custom systems I have setup on my project car, a BMW E36, which has an Arduino Mega and Raspberry Pi 4 installed on it to gather data and control certain parts of the car to optimize performance.

Systems:
- PWM Fan Control
- Fuel Pump Control
- Traction Control Algorithms
