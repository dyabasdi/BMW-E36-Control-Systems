PWM Fan Control:

- MOSFET to vary voltage based off PWM signal from Arduino
- 12V Fans (two radiator fans on my car)
- Inputs:
    - Coolant Temperature (tap in to factory coolant sensor reading)
    - Engine RPM (to estimate water pump flow rate)
    - Vehicle Speed (to turn fans off when car is getting enough airflow)
- Outputs:
    - PWM Signal to MOSFET controlling Fan Speed between 0 and 12V

Traction Control:
- Inputs: 
    - VR to Hall Effect Sensor Converters
    - Engine RPM Input (used to calculate gear)
- Outputs:
    - Analog Signal to ECU between 0 and 5V indicating the amount to retard the ignition/boost cut
